Solutions for C++ Mentoring Program

## Possible improvements:

There are code duplictions in 
1) MultithreadingCopyTool and MultiprocessingCopyTool
2) Validators

Should have separate layer for input, not right in copy

Unit tests - none
Perfomance tests - none

Need implementation of MultiprocessingChunkController on raw shared memory, not on queue and then test perfomance

Testing was happy-path oriented. Need to test and debug cases with nymerous processes in different order
